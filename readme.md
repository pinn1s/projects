# proof i use debian (partially)
## disclaimer
this is a joke. the rest here is totally imagination. if youre reading this consider this as a bedtime story and dont care abt that
btw all screenshots are real bc i really captured them in the debian wild
the truth is: i use 100% windows. the rest is totally vm. i said "i typed this in debian" is real but in the vm itself
## introduction
people thought i use windows as always and some people (if youre not one of the list then the "people" here are people in my imagination) said i dont use linux and i was a total jerk. so im here to proof that i actually use linux os, preferably debian. even i type this whole readme.md using debian, so who cares? i dont either
## proof i use debien (r/ihaveastroke)
### list of all my knowledge abt linux here
#### what the fuck is a sudo mode?
god mode (means that you can just do anything with ur pc idc)
but be cautious bc its not recommended. just one typo since youve had sudo mode- oh wait i seem this aint correct lemme see...

#### how do you install software?

proof: the bug was there at the time im writing uhh it was august 26 8:25 PM at the timezone of hanoi
